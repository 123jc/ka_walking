Walking maps for Karlsruhe

Walking around town is fun, because you get to see and experience so much more than when you quickly pass by on your bike - or even tram, bus or car. But it takes longer. So sometimes you may want to know beforehand just how long it is going to take you to walk to a specific place. That's where these maps come in. They are intended to
1) help you to quickly assess the approximate time of your trip
2) discover new places to walk to or relations to walk on.
3) start and drive a discussion on what makes a city walkable, and by extension livable.

Open to suggestions and improvements of any kind.

The svg files are created and edited with inkscape (https://inkscape.org).
The pdf files are exported from there.

The project was inspired by the fine walking map of the Irish city of Limerick (https://www.limerick.ie/sites/default/files/media/documents/2019-10/Limerick%20City%20Walking%20Map.pdf, https://www.limerick.ie/discover/visiting/travel-guide/visitor-maps-guides/limerick-city-walking-map)
